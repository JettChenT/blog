      <description>Recently, a federal judge ruled against the Internet Archive in their mission to preserve ebooks. While this doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with the WayBack Machine, it led me to wonder: why do we need a centralized platform to take and share website snapshots in the first place? Why not let users take them themselves and share them around the internet?&#xA;The answer to this question seems obvious at first glance.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been playing around with shodan images, a service provided by shodan that aggregates screenshots of accesible videofeeds over the internet of things, including a lot of windows login screens and webcams.&#xA;The catch is, while they provide the screenshot for the users, shodan provides absolutely no hints as of how they obtained the screenshot.&#xA;Shodan claims that they grabbed those screenshots based as the RDP service is exposed to the internet, but when I tried to access the remote desktops with Microsoft Remote Desktop, it immediately prompted me for a username and password, which I do not have.</description>

      <description>About: TIL TIL stands for &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned,&amp;rdquo; and I plan to write a TIL post whenever I discover something interesting. It could be related to anything: from technology to life.&#xA;This is inspired by 100daystooffload and various TIL posts I found over the internet. This can motivate me to keep finding interesting things to learn and experience, improve my writing a little bit, and, most importantly, be an intriguing read.</description>
