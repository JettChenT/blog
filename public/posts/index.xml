      <description>We got global rank 10 in PicoCTF 2024!&#xA;Elements This problem is essentially an XSS + CSP bypass. The XSS part was easy: we need to construct a dependency tree to build the XSS element. For this, I used topological sorting.&#xA;import graphlib recipies = [[&amp;#34;Ash&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Fire&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Charcoal&amp;#34;],[&amp;#34;Steam Engine&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Water&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Vapor&amp;#34;],[&amp;#34;Brick Oven&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Heat Engine&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Oven&amp;#34;], ...] orig = [&amp;#39;Fire&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Water&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Earth&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Air&amp;#39;] dependencies = {} for r in recipies: dependencies[r[2]] = [r[0], r[1]] dep_set = set() dep_graph = {} def trace_dependency(dep, level = 0): if dep in dep_set: return if dep in dependencies: dep_graph[dep] = set(dependencies[dep]) for d in dependencies[dep]: if d in orig: continue trace_dependency(d, level+1) trace_dependency(&amp;#34;XSS&amp;#34;) ts = graphlib.</description>

      <title>Why archive.org can&#39;t prove the authenticity of their snapshots</title>

      <description>Recently, a federal judge ruled against the Internet Archive in their mission to preserve ebooks. While this doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with the WayBack Machine, it led me to wonder: why do we need a centralized platform to take and share website snapshots in the first place? Why not let users take them themselves and share them around the internet?&#xA;The answer to this question seems obvious at first glance.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been playing around with shodan images, a service provided by shodan that aggregates screenshots of accesible videofeeds over the internet of things, including a lot of windows login screens and webcams.&#xA;The catch is, while they provide the screenshot for the users, shodan provides absolutely no hints as of how they obtained the screenshot.&#xA;Shodan claims that they grabbed those screenshots based as the RDP service is exposed to the internet, but when I tried to access the remote desktops with Microsoft Remote Desktop, it immediately prompted me for a username and password, which I do not have.</description>

      <description>About: TIL TIL stands for &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned,&amp;rdquo; and I plan to write a TIL post whenever I discover something interesting. It could be related to anything: from technology to life.&#xA;This is inspired by 100daystooffload and various TIL posts I found over the internet. This can motivate me to keep finding interesting things to learn and experience, improve my writing a little bit, and, most importantly, be an intriguing read.</description>

      <description>Recently, my favorite tv show, Better Call Saul, has ended, and it ended spectacularly&#xA;Midjourney is a public-facing text-to-image generator that I found often more fun and artistic than DALL-E.&#xA;To pay tribute to this amazing show, here are some Midjourney generations regarding BCS. It&amp;rsquo;s really amazing how the model captures the show&amp;rsquo;s visual style, and might have predicted Saul&amp;rsquo;s fate in prison!&#xA;The Generations Saul in prison, black and white &amp;ldquo;Saul Gone&amp;rdquo; poster, black and white &amp;ldquo;Saul Gone&amp;rdquo; poster black and white 2: The prison bars and the head figure in &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; largely exceeded my expectations for AI generated art.</description>

      <description>Problem description The challenge has a downloadable part. After extracting the zip file, we have a NTUSER.DAT&#xA;Prerequisites NTUSER.DAT is a windows generated file which contains the information of the user account settings and customizations.&#xA;After some research on the internet, I fond that Regripper and RegistryExplorer are the two useful tools of conducting forensics on NTUSER.DAT files.&#xA;Download both of the tools from the links above onto a windows machine/vm.</description>
