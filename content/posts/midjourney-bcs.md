Recently, my favorite tv show, Better Call Saul, has ended, and [it](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11630828/?ref_=tt_eps_rec) [ended](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/better-call-saul-finale-breaking-bad-bob-odenkirk-rhea-seehorn-1235200187/) [spectacularly](https://www.tvguide.com/news/better-call-saul-series-finale-review/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa3b&ServiceType=twitter&UniqueID=293ABFF8-1E4A-11ED-904E-0B7396E8478F&PostType=image&TheTime=2022-08-17T16%3A32%3A18)

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) is a public-facing text-to-image generator that I found often more fun and artistic than DALL-E.

To pay tribute to this amazing show, here are some [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) generations regarding BCS.
It's really amazing how the model captures the show's visual style, and might have predicted Saul's fate in prison!

# The Generations
Saul in prison, black and white

"Saul Gone" poster black and white 2: The prison bars and the head figure in "A" largely exceeded my expectations for AI generated art.

# Thoughts
Given the [increasingly widespread use](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/15/tiktok-in-app-text-to-image-ai-generator/) of text-to-image models,
the widespread use of [text-to-video](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) model sounds like an inevitibility.
I believe, in the next show I watch that's as good as BCS, models like text2image or text2video will play a huge part in it, for better or worse.
